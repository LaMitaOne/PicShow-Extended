# PicShow-Extended
Extended version of the popular Delphi PicShow component with a total of 179 transition effects (original had 176).     
        
## About This Project    
    
This library is based on **PicShow 4.20** by Mohammad Hossein Daneshpajouh (DelphiArea).    
    
I simply added **39 new transition effects** – that's it.  
The new effects are integrated into the existing code structure.    
   
Basic sample exe included
